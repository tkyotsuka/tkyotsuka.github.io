**Privacy Policy for AR Athena**

_Last updated: January 17, 2024_

**Introduction:**
At AR Athena, we are dedicated to protecting the privacy and maintaining the trust of our users. We firmly believe in not monetizing personal data, meaning we do not engage in selling, renting, or trading email lists or any personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

### 1. Information We Collect and Use
AR Athena is designed as an ad-free, augmented reality (AR) application that does not collect, process, store, or transmit any personal information. The camera is utilized exclusively for AR functionalities, ensuring that all data is processed locally on your device without being shared with or transmitted to any servers or third parties.

### 2. Security Measures
While we prioritize the security of any data, it's important to note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is infallible. However, AR Athena is committed to implementing commercially reasonable measures to protect any information processed by the app.

**Children's Privacy:**

As a part of our commitment to children's safety and privacy:
- **Content Appropriateness:** We ensure that all content in AR Athena is suitable and secure for children, actively moderating any user-generated content to shield minors from inappropriate material.
- **Ad-Free Experience:** Understanding the importance of a distraction-free environment for children, AR Athena offers an uninterrupted, ad-free user experience.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** AR Athena adheres to all relevant children's privacy laws and regulations, including the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), guaranteeing a secure and lawful user environment.
